 Intermediate SQL Project: NYC Airbnb Data Analysis
 
This is an intermediate-level SQL project where I worked with the New York City Airbnb Open Data from Kaggle. Using SQLite in Google Colab, I am writing complex SQL queries to explore and analyze real-world housing and pricing data.

üîç Key Highlights:

Connected and queried data from a real dataset using SQLite.

Wrote and executed intermediate SQL queries including GROUP BY, HAVING, JOIN, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and subqueries.

Analyzed listings by price, location, and host performance to uncover trends in the NYC short-term rental market.

üõ†Ô∏è Skills Used: SQL, SQLite, Google Colab, Data Analysis, Pandas
