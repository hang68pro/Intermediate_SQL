 Intermediate SQL Project: NYC Airbnb Data Analysis
 
This is an intermediate-level SQL project where I worked with the New York City Airbnb Open Data from Kaggle. Using SQLite in Google Colab, I am writing complex SQL queries to explore and analyze real-world housing and pricing data.


üîç Key Highlights:

Connected and queried data from a real dataset using SQLite.

Wrote and executed intermediate SQL queries including GROUP BY, HAVING, JOIN, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and subqueries.

Analyzed listings by price, location, and host performance to uncover trends in the NYC short-term rental market.

üõ†Ô∏è Skills Used: SQL, SQLite, Google Colab, Data Analysis, Pandas


üîë Key Insights from NYC Airbnb Analysis:

Most Expensive Listings: Identified the top 5 most expensive Airbnb listings across New York City, especially among entire homes/apartments, revealing luxury rental trends.

Popular Neighborhoods: Found that Manhattan and Brooklyn dominate in both the number of listings and average prices, with neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Harlem being particularly active.

Price Distribution: A significant portion of listings are under $100 per night, but there is a long tail of luxury properties with prices well above $500.

Room Type Trends: Entire homes/apartments account for the highest average prices, while private rooms are far more common and affordable.

Host Activity: Some hosts manage dozens of listings, indicating the presence of commercial hosting operations beyond individual rentals.
